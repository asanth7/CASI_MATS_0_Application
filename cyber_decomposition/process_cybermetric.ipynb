    "By the results above, we retain a[2] as our example cybersecurity benchmark dataset of 68 questions (questions refused by Sonnet 4.5, where 1 or 2 of the 3 weaker/open-source models responded incorrectly). These questions are saved in file `final_dataset.json`, in the same format as the original CyberMetric dataset (in the file `CyberMetric-500-v1.json`) but include an additional attribute `correct_models` which stores a list of the models that answered the question correctly (1 or 2 of Mistral, Llama, and/or DeepSeek). Note that Deepseek V3.1 and Mistral Magistral Small 2506 dramatically outperform Llama 3.2 3B Instruct in accuracy on these questions. **Furthermore, note that *none* of these models refused to answer a single question. Since all models answer questions correctly approximately half of the time (70/146 questions) and one or two are incorrect with similar proportion (68/146), this suggests that the questions are solveable by open-source, less-aligned language models and yet are refused by strong, aligned models.** However, note that this example was conducted with relatively limited data, a few open- and closed-source models, and should thus be replicated and expanded on for statistical significance and robustness of results.
